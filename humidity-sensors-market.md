<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Humidity Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Relative Humidity Sensor</li><li>Absolute Humidity Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The humidity sensor market comprises two primary types: relative humidity sensors and absolute humidity sensors. Relative humidity sensors measure the percentage of moisture in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the air can hold at a given temperature. They are widely used in HVAC systems and weather stations. Absolute humidity sensors, on the other hand, quantify the total mass of water vapor present in the air, providing a more direct measurement of moisture content. Both types are crucial for environmental monitoring and industrial applications.</p></p>

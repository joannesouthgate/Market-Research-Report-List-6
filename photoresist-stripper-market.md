<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Stripper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Type Photoresist Stripper</li><li>Negative Type Photoresist Stripper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photoresist stripper market consists of two main types: positive and negative photoresist strippers. Positive type strippers are designed to remove photoresist that has been exposed to light, leaving the unexposed areas intact, making them ideal for finer patterning in semiconductor manufacturing. Negative type strippers, on the other hand, remove the unexposed photoresist, retaining the patterns of exposed areas. These products are essential in the semiconductor and microfabrication industries for ensuring high-quality and precise pattern transfer on substrates.</p></p>
